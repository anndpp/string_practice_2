1. Count Characters: Write a program that asks the user to enter a string and counts the occurrence of each character in the string. Display the character and its corresponding count.

2. Capitalize Words: Write a program that takes a sentence as input and capitalizes the first letter of each word. For example, if the input is "hello world", the output should be "Hello World".

3. Remove Whitespace: Write a program that takes a string as input and removes all whitespace characters from it. Display the modified string.

4. String Palindrome Check (Sentence): Modify the previous palindrome check exercise to work with sentences. Ignore any punctuation and whitespace while checking if the sentence is a palindrome. For example, "A man, a plan, a canal - Panama!" should be considered a palindrome.

5. Character Frequency: Write a program that asks the user to enter a string and determines the frequency of each character in the string. Display the character and its frequency sorted by descending frequency.

6. String Compression: Write a program that takes a string as input and compresses it by replacing consecutive repeated characters with the character followed by the count. For example, if the input is "aaabbccccdd", the output should be "a3b2c4d2".

7. Sentence Reverse: Write a program that takes a sentence as input and reverses the order of words in the sentence. For example, if the input is "Hello world, how are you?", the output should be "you? are how world, Hello".
